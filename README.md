This is my Data Structures Project in java done as part of the course Data Structures in my 1st year, 2nd Semester.
This project is to maintain the Dictionary of words in alphabetical order. 
In original file Dictionary.java, I have done it very simple and basic using just arraylist of maintaining words in 
alphabetical order.
Dictionary2.java is a sophisticated project where, I have both word and it's meaning in a hashmap.
